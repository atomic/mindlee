Mindlee - Free your mind
====

In the midst of our midterm season, we found ourselves stressed out cramming for our tests and working on projects for class. Before we knew it, our productivity was lower, we had a harder time focusing on our work, and we also felt less happy with our lives. Although classes are important, by the end of the day, we need to take care of ourselves and maintain a healthy mindset for the long-term. Thus, we wanted to find a way to reconnect with nature and be more mindful of the stresses that stem from our environment. Once we develop that awareness, we need to find a way to let go, relax, and breathe.

User Testing
====
Our user testing on our prototypes have led to several changes that improved the application’s usability and aesthetics. The most useful feedback that we received was on how we could accurately represent a user’s stress level. Thus, we carried out A/B testing on two different iterations of the stress value slider to see which version the user preferred. The results led us to a more intuitive design.
